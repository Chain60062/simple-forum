This is a forum written in TypeScript for studying purposes. It uses the following libraries:

Backend: Express, Multer...
Frontend: React, Tanstack Query, Vite, Styled Components, React Icons...

To run it first change directory and install all packages(both in the server directory and the client one):
```
npm install # or
pnpm install # or
yarn install
```

## Client
You should be run `npm install` in the client directory first before running any of the scripts. To run a development server locally run:
```
npm run dev
```
## Database
In the server/config/db folder there is a sql file, just run the script and make sure you got the most recent Postgresql version.

## Server
The server dependencies should also be installed with `npm install`. To run a development server locally run:
Again, to run it use:
```
npm run dev
```
That's it, make sure that the database, client and server are running and the application should be fully functional, have fun.
